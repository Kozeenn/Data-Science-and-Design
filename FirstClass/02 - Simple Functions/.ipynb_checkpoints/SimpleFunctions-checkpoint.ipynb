    "\n",
    "*Functions* are an important concept in programming. The idea is that they take some code that gets used lots of times, and wrap it up so that you can re-use it. It's a bit like creating a small tool. Creating a function means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- other people can use it, without having to do the same work\n",
    "- You can put time into making sure that it works, and then it'll keep on working\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put lots of functions together, to make more complex ones - its a bit like working with Lego.\n",

Each library does a certain task - for example, the `math` libary gives you lots of maths functions, the `random` library gives you lots of ways to work with random numbers. You'll find lots of them on the python library page (https://docs.python.org/3/library/) but there are many more that you can install. Here, we'll just look at how you can use *some* of the functions provided.\n",

    "You'll often see the following two ways of importing things:\n",
    "- `import random as rn`. This is just like doing `import random`, but where you would write e.g. `random.randrange`, you write `rn.randrange`. You can replace `rn` with anything, so long as you are consistent. So you could write `import random as flying_elephant` if you're happy to keep writing `flying_elephant.randrange` every time you want to use the function. It's mostly used to make things shorter, and there are some common short names that people use - if you stick to those, it'll be easier to share code. Examples `import pandas as pd`, `import seaborn as sns`.\n",
    "- `from random import choice`. This is a bit different. Now, instead of writing `random.choice([True,False])` in your code, you can just write `choice([True,False])`. This makes your code shorter, but it's harder for someone else to figure out what `choice` means, or what library it belongs to. You can import lots of things this way, e.g. `from random import choice, randrange`."
